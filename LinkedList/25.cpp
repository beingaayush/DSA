// Problem Statement:-
// You are given the head of a linked list and an integer k.
// Reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.
// Rules:
// Divide the linked list into consecutive groups of size k.
// Reverse the nodes in each group.
// If the number of nodes in the last group is less than k, leave them unchanged.
// You are not allowed to change the values inside nodes — only rearrange the node connections.
