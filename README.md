# Along with Data structures, Patterns are also covered.
# Language Used : C++

# Each subfolder contains a content.txt file, 
and the file contains - The problem names along with their LeetCode numbers.

# For better understanding and logic implementation, 
> Always start with content.txt file inside a folder.
> Go with the serial order inside the file

# For each Solution, Their Problem Statement & core idea is mentioned above as comment 😊
